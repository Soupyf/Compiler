# Compiler
Group project at Compiler course in SUSTech, 2022 Fall. This project builds rules and production expressions that conform to the Flex and Bison specifications for lexical
and syntax analysis, and constructs an abstract syntax tree in C for semantic checking and intermediate code generation. It also implements some simple optimizations, and is finally validated using irsim.
